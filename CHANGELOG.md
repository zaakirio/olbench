and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Auto-detection of installed Ollama models via API
- Smart download size estimation using real file sizes for installed models
- Pattern-based size estimation for unknown models (e.g., `gemma3:4b` â†’ ~2.5GB)
- Detailed verbose output showing installed vs missing models
- Enhanced CLI output with accurate download requirements

### Fixed
- Bug where download estimates were shown for already installed models
- Improved model detection reliability using `/api/tags` endpoint

### Changed
- Model discovery now dynamically detects installed models instead of relying on static database
- Size reporting shows actual disk usage for installed models
- Download estimates only shown for models that actually need downloading
